    <h3> <b class="text-primary">Python Program Obfuscator</b></h3>
    <p> The project main objective is to develop a multiplatform Python program 
      obfuscation tool which can easily safeguard the source code for the people
      who want to protect their intellectual property rights or manage their sensitive 
      software algorithm.  This tool will seamlessly obfuscate and encode the sensitive 
      source code into unreadable but Python-interpreter executable bytes data which 
      can be mixed executed with normal python code. Additionally, it will offer 
      a decoder to revert obfuscated byte data back to its original source code.

    <h4> <span class="badge badge-secondary">Introduction </span> </h4>
    <p> Program obfuscation is a widely adopted common technique for enhancing the 
        security of Python applications. There are various obfuscation libraries 
        and tools exist in the market, such as <a href="https://pyarmor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">[pyarm] </a> 
        or <a href="https://freecodingtools.org/py-obfuscator">[free online tool's obfuscation tool] </a>. 
        The obfuscation process will employ methods such as identifier renaming, code encryption, code packing 
        dead code insertion and so on, it effectively makes it difficult for hackers to understand the 
        execution/control flow and safeguards sensitive source code from unauthorized access. But most of 
        the current obfuscation tools don't provide the features like decoding algorithms, customization of 
        obfuscation result size , or the selection of whether obfuscate entire/part of file.

        <p>Inspired by the concept of free online tool's obfuscation tool], 
          our goal is to develop a web-based Python program obfuscation tool 
          with the following key features:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dd> &#149; &nbsp Provide multi-layer Python code obfuscation with customizable 
            encoded obfuscated code sizes.
          </dd>

          <dd> &#149; &nbsp Provide provision of both encoder and decoder functions to 
            facilitate maintenance and debugging of obfuscated code.
          </dd>

          <dd> &#149; &nbsp Provide capability to obfuscate entire Python programs or 
            specific sections of source code for added flexibility.
          </dd>
          

          <dd> &#149; &nbsp Integration of flexible code randomization techniques to 
            ensure that each generated obfuscated code is unique, even when derived 
            from the same source code.
          </dd>

          <dd> &#149; &nbsp Provision of a standardized API for users to seamlessly integrate 
            the tool into their projects, coupled with a user-friendly Web UI for 
            convenient encoding and decoding operations.
