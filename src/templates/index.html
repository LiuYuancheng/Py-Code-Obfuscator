    <h3> Threats To MITRE(<b class="text-primary">CWD</b>, <b class="text-warning" >ATT&CK</b>) AI-LLM Mapper </h3>
    <p> The primary objective of this program is to leverage AI-LLM technology to streamline the processing
       of human language-based threat scenario documents, including technical blogs, CTI reports, online threats 
       introduction materials and cyber attack training notes. The goal is to succinctly summarize the attack flow 
       path outlined within such materials via mapping the attack behaviors to the MITRE-ATT&CK Matrix and matching 
       the vulnerabilities to the MITRE-CWE Tree.  </p>

    <h4> <span class="badge badge-secondary">Introduction </span> </h4>
    <p> Our objective is to develop an AI LLM-based tool/library that simplifies the analysis of human language 
        threat scenario descriptions found in technical blogs, CTI reports, and cyber attack training notes. This 
        tool will allow user to pass in the original human threats report contents and automate the generation of 
        MITRE ATT&CK Matrix mappings and MITRE CWE Tree matches process. To achieve this, the program will undertake 
        the following tasks:
    </p>
    <p> &#149; <b>Cyber Attack Behaviors </b>: The program will parse the document to extract cyber attack 
        behaviors, delineating each behavior individually. Subsequently, it will map these behaviors to the MITRE 
        ATT&CK Matrix, thereby discerning the associated attack tactics and techniques. </p>
    <p> &#149; <b>Detecting Vulnerabilities</b>: Additionally, the program will identify vulnerabilities mentioned 
        within the threat descriptions. It will then cross-reference these vulnerabilities with the MITRE Common 
        Weakness Enumeration (CWE) to establish corresponding matches. </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Material Summarization</dt>
          <dd> &#149; Leveraging AI LLM, we will analyze lengthy threat descriptions to summarize attack

          <dt>Attack Behavior Parsing</dt>
          <dd> &#149; The summarized threats will be input into the LLM Attack Behavior Analyzer to 
            extract a list of individual attack behaviors.</dd>

          <dt>Attack Behavior Mapping</dt>
          <dd> &#149; Each individual behavior will be mapped to relevant techniques in the MITRE

          <dd> &#149; Different AI LLM models will be employed to verify if the results match the
